### Nathan Groves
### Description:

This program reads in data from json file into AVL trees and linked lists to compare search complexity time with each other.

### Files

|   #   | File     | Description                      |
| :---: | -------- | -------------------------------- |
|   1   | main.cpp | Main driver of avl tree program. |
|   2   | json.hpp | json library implementation |
|   3   | LinkedList.hpp | Linked List definition |

### Instructions:

- Create avl instances in main and insert them into a manager map.
- Create linked list instances in main
- Modify search keys and review search times for different data members.
- When reading in from an input file, ensure proper json format and file type.
