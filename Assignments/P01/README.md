## P01 - AVL Tree Database
### Nathan Groves
### Description:

This program reads in data from a json file into AVL trees and linked lists to compare search complexity times with each other. Primarily, this is to showcase and print the superior O(log n) search comparisons and times of AVL trees.

### Files

|   #   | File     | Description                      |
| :---: | -------- | -------------------------------- |
|   1   | main.cpp | Main driver of avl tree program. |
|   2   | json.hpp | json library implementation |
|   3   | LinkedList.hpp | Linked List definition |
|   4   | Timer.hpp | timer definition to time runtimes |
|   5   | random_person_data1.json | example json info to read in |

### Instructions:

- Create avl instances in main and insert them into a manager map.
- Create linked list instances in main
- Modify search keys and review search times for different data members.
- When reading in from an input file, ensure proper json format and file type.
